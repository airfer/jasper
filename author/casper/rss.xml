	     <p><strong>前言：</strong>
在基于<a href="https://testerhome.com/topics/6184">Docker的分布式测试系统构建（一）</a>中主要阐述了两个方面的内容，分别为开发此分布式测试系统的缘由以及docker基础镜像的构建和踩过的坑。在本篇中主要有4个部分的内容，分别为分布式测试系统的架构、技术实现细节简述、docker Node节点的部署，以及前端实现。</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>—-  搜狗ADTQ测试组出品</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<h2 id="section">一、分布式测试系统的架构</h2>
<p>整体的测试架构主要Docker Nodes节点，Mongodb Broker，Mongodb DB, Front Web，这4个部分构成，其实现的架构简图如下所示：
<img src="/images/pc_ads_distribution/base-framework.jpg" alt="" />
现在就每个部分简要叙述：</p>

<p><em>1. Docker Node节点简述</em>
Docker Node节点主要有Celery 异步框架，Celery Worker任务，Nosetests 测试框架，Mock服务构成。
其分布式实现主要有Celery来完成，通过编写Celery worker 任务来实现具体的测试逻辑。由于业务逻辑本身的需求情况，分层级的调用关系成为实现的有效途径。Celery Worker从Mongodb Broker接收需要完成的任务信息，然后调用Node节点本身的Nosetests框架和Shell脚本，最后调用Mock Service辅助完成测试任务。Celery Worker完成待定的测试任务后，将测试结果写入MongoBD 数据库中以备前端调用。</p>

<p><em>2. Docker Swarm</em>
由于本系统的docker node节点并不多，考虑实现成本以及后续管理难易程度，本系统使用Swarm来管理docker node节点。如果docker node节点众多，可以考虑k8s。关于docker swarm在第二部分会进行说明，这里不在叙述。</p>

<p><em>3. Mogondb</em>
在本系统中，MongoDB主要有两个方面的用途。用途一，作为Celery 的broker，接收前端发送过来的任务请求信息，当broker中有数据时，Celery Worker从broker中获取数据，完成后续任务执行过程；用途二，作为DataBase，Celery worker完成任务后，将result.json数据写入到数据库中</p>

<p><em>4. 前端实现</em>
由于部门内当前的web系统，使用的是Flask Web框架，所以前端主要由Flask + Jquery + Bootstrap实现
整个架构实现还算比较清晰，这对后期的维护也带来了方便。</p>

<h2 id="section-1">二、技术实现有关细节简述</h2>

<p><em>1. 关于使用Celery作为异步框架</em>
由于测试用例本身都是基于python来开发的，并且web系统为Flask，所以有充分的理由选择Celery,关于异步框架的选择可以参考<a href="https://testerhome.com/topics/5732">基于 Docker 集群的分布式测试系统 DDT (DockerDistributedTest)</a>文章中对异步框架的对比。</p>

<p><em>2. 关于Nosetests的插件化</em>
默认安装的nosetests是并未安装json插件的，但是提供xml格式。为了便于后续的结果处理，需要事先安装json插件。这里还有一个小插曲，由于之前从来都是使用默认的插件，都不太清楚原来nosetests也可以私自开发插件并安装，走了不少弯路。当然json的插件不需要自己再重复造轮子，可以直接下载安装。</p>

<p>由于nosetests提供了xml格式报告输出，所以第一时间选择的是xml作为最后的结果报文格式。用到–with-xunit参数，同时需要安装nosexunit插件，但是安装的过程中，需要coverage特定版本的支持，为2.85版本。但是即使安装了2.85版本的支持包，<a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/coverage/2.85">https://pypi.python.org/pypi/coverage/2.85</a>也同样会报错。</p>

<p>安装后，使用–with-xunit来运行，会提示如下信息：<em>NameError: global name ‘pylint’ is not defined</em>。但是pylint已经被正确安装，出现这个错误很是匪夷所思。后来以为是nosexunit的版本的问题，现在安装的是最新版本0.3.3，后来换成0.3.2和0.3.1都会出现错误，暂时还没有发现原因。所以最后还是使用json作为结果输出格式。</p>

<p><em>3. 关于测试数据以及环境准备</em>
数据更新以及运行相关环境的准备，总体来说可以有两种大的途径，可总结为远程拉取，和本地挂载。</p>

<p><em>- 远程拉取</em></p>

<p>远程拉取可以有多种方法，第一种为通过rsync方法，将目的机中的数据远程拉取到docker node中，但是由于运行环境的数据量太大，所以当初认为并不可行。经过统计，在内网中完全拉取大小在5.5G左右的文件夹，需要6分钟左右，这个时间太长了。所以当初这个方案是被废弃了。</p>

<p>第二种方法为使用svn或者git，svn的话对于一些特别大的文件，会提示上传受到限制，这种情况下可以使用svn ignore对某些大的文件进行排除，后来发现由于文件夹太大的原因导致svn报错，使用svn ignore属性同样不能解决问题，现在svn报错也还无法查明原因。</p>

<p><em>- 本地挂载</em></p>

<p>通过将所需要的文件传输到docker node宿主机中，然后在运行docker node的时候通过docker -v 本地挂载的形式，可以比较方便的解决环境问题。但是这样会使得部署一个node节点也复杂了一步，必须先同步环境相关数据到docker宿主机，这样又绕回了问题本身。所以本地挂载在本分布式测试系统中并不合适。</p>

<p>所以最后还是要考虑第一个方案。在仔细研究了rsync服务后，发现之前对rsync的研究并不深入，并不清楚rsync的差异性同步模式，通过这篇文章进行了详细的了解，<a href="https://segmentfault.com/a/1190000002427568">https://segmentfault.com/a/1190000002427568</a>，最后决定使用rsync的方式来进行文件同步。
举例如下：
```shell
rsync -auvrtzopgP –progress –delete  –exclude “core.*”   –exclude “your/log” 192.168.56.73::root/the/des/directory/  ./ 
#receiving incremental file list</p>

<h1 id="sent-17376-bytes--received-2397856-bytes--53671822-bytessec">sent 17376 bytes  received 2397856 bytes  536718.22 bytes/sec</h1>
<p>#total size is 17239007382  speedup is 7137.62
```
通过设置–exclude 参数可以将不需要同步的文件排除，比如日志文件，这在实践中很有用</p>

<p><em>4. 关于分布式系统的执行粒度</em>
在第一篇文章中我有提，现在的分布式系统执行的最小粒度是文件，也就是说nosetests 在运行测试程序时，最小是全部执行某一个文件中所有的case。比如A.py文件中有10个cases，而B.py文件有50cases，那么运行过程是node1运行A.py中的所有case，node2运行B.py中的所有cases。由于A.py中的cases比较少，所以node1运行完成后，就闲置了。而总的运行时间有node2来决定，这种情况下系统的资源被浪费了。</p>

<p>当以casesID作为执行的基本单元时，这种情况就不复存在了，假如运行一个case为1分钟，那么原先需要运行50min才能运行完所有的case。而在现有的执行粒度下，只需要30min就可以运行完所有的case。关于python文件中casesID的收集，可以通过nosetests –collect-only命令来进行收集。</p>

<p><em>5. 关于Celery worker的命令</em>
由于每一个cases的运行都需要Mock Service的支持，其主程序在内存中只允许运行一个实例，所以每一个docker node节点每次只可以运行一个case，否则便会相互影响。在解决这个问题的时候走了不少弯路，后来在仔细研究了celery worker的命令后，发现可以通过celery worker的运行时参数就可以控制，当时便有一个柳暗花明又一村的感觉。
举例如下：
<code class="highlighter-rouge">shell
celery -A pc_ads_distribute_worker worker -c 1 --maxtasksperchild=1 -l INFO
</code>
其中的-c参数表示worker并发为1，–maxtasksperchild表示每一个worker最多有几个孩子，同样设置为1，这样就可以满足具体业务测试要求了</p>

<h2 id="docker-node">三、docker node节点部署</h2>

<p>在已经有了docker 镜像后，需要搭建私有的docker registry来方面docker宿主机更新docker镜像，关于docker 私有registry的搭建可以参考如下的网址，这里不再累述了：</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/docker/distribution/blob/master/docs/index.md">https://github.com/docker/distribution/blob/master/docs/index.md</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/docker/docker.github.io/blob/master/registry/index.md">https://github.com/docker/docker.github.io/blob/master/registry/index.md</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.open-open.com/lib/view/open1456539405281.html">http://www.open-open.com/lib/view/open1456539405281.html</a></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>关于具体的使用方法示例如下：
```shell
#Images查询地址：
curl  http://192.168.56.73:5000/v2/_catalog
#Tags查询：
curl  http://192.168.56.73:5000/v2/pc/centos6.6_base/tags/list</p>

<h1 id="section-2">具体使用方法：</h1>
<p>docker tag centos6.6:program_auto_v3.6 192.168.56.73:5000/pc/program_auto_v3.6
docker push 192.168.56.73:5000/pc/program_auto_v3.6
docker pull 192.168.56.73:5000/pc/program_auto_v3.6
```
由于我测试系统中，并未升级到引擎的1.2.1版本，所以需要下载额外的swarm镜像来完成，关于如何通过swarm来管理docker node镜像由于比较简单，就不多写了，有兴趣的可以参考<a href="http://dockone.io/article/227">http://dockone.io/article/227</a>来配置。</p>

<h2 id="section-3">四、前端部分</h2>

<p>前端的展示主要有三个部分组成，分别为生成分布式任务、测试任务预览、测试任务统计与查询</p>

<p><em>1. 生成分布式任务及测试任务预览</em>
<img src="/images/pc_ads_distribution/distribute_auto_pic1" alt="" /></p>

<p>左边栏包含两个主要部分，分别为填写svn的地址以及上传文件。
svn地址为必填，因为分布式测试任务必须要明确是对svn的哪个版本进行的分布式测试；上传文件为可选，如果不上传文件，则运行所有测试用例，如果上传文件，则只运行上传文件中写明的测试用例文件以及确定的caseid，这个功能在只需要运行测试用例集中的某一个子集时比较有用，右边为生成的任务预览模块，每生成一次任务则新增一条记录。</p>

<p><em>2. 任务执行统计</em>
<img src="/images/pc_ads_distribution/distribute_auto_pic2" alt="" />
这个图比较清楚就不再说明了</p>

<p><em>3. 具体任务查询</em>
<img src="/images/pc_ads_distribution/distribute_auto_pic3" alt="" /></p>

<p>可查询某一次具体的执行情况，必须根据运行的成功还是失败，或者根据具体的文件名来查询都可以</p>

<h2 id="section-4">五、结语</h2>

<p>这两篇算是对之前所做工作的一个总结吧。一天连写两篇，有种写吐了的感觉，好了，就这样吧，希望对各位童鞋有帮助……</p>

	  <description><![CDATA[
	     <h2 id="section"><strong><em>前言：</em></strong></h2>

<p>最近一段时间一直在忙着平台开发的一些事情，一直都没有时间梳理和总结这过程中的点滴。下个月要准备述职报告，所以就借着这个机会把测试过程中的一些感受记下来，以飨各位看官。本篇是杂谈，所以不谈具体技术，只谈风月。。。</p>

<h3 id="section-1"><strong>一、论工具之稳定性压倒一切</strong></h3>

<p>作为一名测试开发工程师，测试工具应该是非常熟悉了，测试工具是测试过程中的好帮手。好的测试工具对于测试人员效率提升以及减少漏测率都有非常大的帮助。测试工具的来源也有很多，有的工具是较为成熟可以直接拿来用的，有的是基于一些开源的项目然后根据自我需求二次开发的，还有一些是对于某些需求特殊定制的等等，那么对于测试工具什么最重要呢？</p>

<p>从标题可以看出我的结论是，稳定性是一个测试工具最核心的需求。当然这并不是说测试工具的执行效率，测试工具的可扩展性以及可维护性不重要，只是相对于这些特征，稳定性才是一个工具必须要保证的特质。</p>

<p>从半年前的入职到现在，搜狗ADTQ测试组给我留下较深印象之一便是持续集成做的非常出色。因为我所在PC组，所以就以PC组举例。现在PC组对于新增的提测单，除了人工的验证新增功能以及样式展示外，其他的全部交给自动化来执行，包括所有case的分布式执行测试、新旧版本的压力测试、新旧版本的对比测试等等。其中令我吃惊的是这些部署在jenkins上的任务，大多是在2014年就已经完成开发，从2014年到现在一直都在稳定的运行，除了进行必要的维护以及case更新之外，这些工具都表现的非常出色。</p>

<p>这些工具大部分是东哥（暂且这么叫吧^^）开发的，主要通过shell脚本来实现，我和东哥也没见过我入职时东哥已经离职了，但这也不妨碍其所做的工具对我们目前工作的帮助。以case的分布式测试为例，其实现分布式也并非用了非常高深的技术，主要是通过jenkins的api以及shell来完成，就这个看似简单其实并不简单的工具支撑着我们每次上线前的500多个case的回归，帮助我们减少漏测的情况。只要case的分布式执行出现问题，比如突然失败几十个，有可能是功能的漏测，也有可能是合并后的代码有误。</p>

<p>这个分布式case的执行工具之所以可以用的现在，其本身程序的稳定性占有很大的比例，如果一个工具每次的运行都不稳定，或者运行的时候时不时的报个错误，出现个exception，你还会信赖它？还会用它吗？</p>

<p>我所希望的工具就是在我需要它的时候，它能够按时完成我交给它的任务，别给我出乱子，这就足够了。我最讨厌的测试工具就是我一边在使用着这个工具，一边忍受其所报的各种错误提示，对于出现的错误我还要调试半天究竟是什么地方出错了。就是这样一件非常简单的要求，又有多少工具能够很好的满足呢，所以我才要特别强调工具稳定性的重要性，我希望即使我以后离开公司，我的工具也可以在仅有必要维护的情况下能够很好的工作。</p>

<p>最近一段时间做了两个内部使用的平台，其中一个就是开发了新的分布式测试系统，改进了原先分布式测试系统的一些缺点。在试运行阶段，修改了各种bug，现在已经上线并取代原有的分布式测试工具。在开发新的分布式测试系统时，我就感觉到要做好一个工具的稳定性真的非常不容易，需要考虑各种可能的情况，比如一些特殊的输入，执行过程中可能出现的异常，还有case执行过程中的一些特殊的依赖等等。</p>

<p>希望新的分布式测试平台能够发扬老一辈分布式测试系统的优点，将稳定性的核心特质保持下去。这里感谢下东哥，在设计新的测试系统时借鉴了很多老平台的优点。</p>

<p>其实当设计平台将稳定性考虑在内时，你就会考虑更多的东西，比如你的系统需要依赖机子A上的某个文件，如果这种依赖关系是硬编码在代码中，那么极有可能出现A机子文件被删除导致获取失败的情况。这种情况下如果是你自己在维护可能还好，如果你已经离职，新入职的员工如何知道你所依赖的这个文件是什么内容，这种依赖关系是否是必须，这些新员工都不清楚。</p>

<p>如果这种依赖关系是可配置的，不管是通过xml还是json或者web界面，并对这种依赖关系进行详细标注，甚至说明所依赖文件的生成方法，那么这种系统的稳定性以及可维护性就要好很多，甚至不需要去读测试工具的代码就能搞定所出现的问题。关于稳定性还有很多的要求，由于我自己也处在学习阶段，所以就先谈到着吧</p>

<h3 id="section-2"><strong>二、论旧工具与新工具的前世今生</strong></h3>

<p>旧工具可以理解为早些时候开发的工具，这些旧的工具有些可能还在使用，有些可能因为年久失修已经废弃了。当需要这些测试工具所提供的功能时，是继续使用这些即使有些缺点但是还可以使用的旧工具，还是花费大量时间精力去开发新的工具，我相信很多测试同学都有过这种选择，在综合权衡下，做出自己的选择。</p>

<p>我知道肯定也有一些同学与我的想法一致，旧的工具用着不顺，新的工具开发成本又太高，那么就综合两者，以旧工具为蓝本添加新的功能修复原有工具的缺点。当然这三种选择并没有孰优孰劣，能根据具体的测试需求综合权衡，做出正确的选择就好。比如原有的工具实在是太难用，而这个工具开发有比较简单，那么可以考虑重新开发一套，具体情况具体论，切勿盲目追从。</p>

<p>本节所谈论的主要是第三种情况，对现有旧工具进行改造，要不怎么说是前世今生呢，哈哈。还是拿我自己举例吧，现在组内的一些工具，比如性能对比工具，其实现起来比较复杂，首先便是需要搭建一套测试环境，然后再进行对比分析，现有旧的工具也还可以使用，像上一节所谈的，稳定性很好，但就是有些缺点比如生成的报告不直观、调用入口单一（大多数情况通过jenkins平台直接调用）、出错排查不方便等。</p>

<p>如果综合权衡考虑这几方面的因素，会发现改进原有旧工具的缺点，并添加所需要的功能是效率最高的。由于现在ADTQ组有一个统一的测试平台，整合了测试组常用的工具，所以考虑是否能够将原有的jenkins任务整合进现有的平台当中，使得调用更加方便，结果展示更加人性化，错误排查容易呢？通过查询资料以及对旧平台代码的通读，发现改造是可行的，是可以实现的。</p>

<p>由于现阶段还没有进行改进开发，所以就大致说一下我自己改进的思路吧：
1. 关于任务的执行、查询、终止等操作全部通过python版本的jenkins api来完成；</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>修改原有的jenkins任务脚本，添加结果收集模块，将收集的结果写入到数据库中，mysql或者Mongodb都可以；</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>重新开发前端页面，主界面主要有任务触发、结果查看等功能。</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>其实这个思路也并不复杂，实现起来的成本也不是很大，主要的工作在于前端页面设计以及和数据库的交互逻辑，这样的改进方法比起重新开发新的工具要省事省力很多。当然也有其他的方法，比如组内的宋大神（非常NB）就利用异步框架Celery加paramiko来实现对脚本的调用，以代替jenkins的工作。改造的方法多种多样，可爱的同学发挥你的聪明才智吧~</p>

<p>旧工具与新工具并非是势同水火的关系，如果能让旧的工具进一步贡献自己的价值那么何乐而不为呢。可能有的同学会问，既然比较推崇对旧工具进行改造，那么你为何又重新开发新的分布式测试平台呢？</p>

<p>其实在本章节我有说过，做出某项选择必然是要经过充分的权衡考虑的，我这里解释一下，旧的平台主要有几个明显的缺点比较难以克服所以才考虑开发新的平台，其一是执行的粒度无法控制，其二是分布式节点部署非常繁琐极易出错。这两点我开发新平台的主要因素，现有的平台在节点部署方面做的非常出色，通过ansible可实现1分钟内将分布式节点由3个扩展到N（具体多少看ansible的性能）个，而旧的平台要实现这样的改进就非常困难，其成本不亚于开发新的平台，所以才考虑开发新的平台</p>

<p>前段时间开发的广告预览平台也是放弃了旧的平台，开发新的平台。之所以做出这样的选择，并非是对旧的平台改造困难，恰恰相反，由于预览平台的技术含量较低，并且有现成的api接口可供调用来完成图片获取，开发的成本较低，同时为了界面更加的友好所以才重新开发。举了这些例子就是想说明，究竟采取那一种方法是需要根据具体情况具体分析的，不能因为某些炫酷的功能而盲目开发新平台，同时也不能因为开发新平台或者改进旧平台的成本太大就放弃努力，得过且过。其实大家都知道我说的是什么意思，这里不再赘述了</p>

<h3 id="section-3"><strong>三、脚踏实地、仰望星空</strong></h3>

<p>温家宝总理说过这样的话：”一个民族有一些关注天空的人，他们才有希望；一个民族只是关心脚下的事情，那是没有未来的”。温家宝总理说这句话时，想表达的是一个国家即需要踏实肯干的人才，也需要有卓越远见，考虑长远的人才。</p>

<p>这句话放在部门内也同样行的通。在当今的社会我们既要做到踏实肯干，同样也需要能跳出当前着眼长远，不要故步自封。如果只是抱着旧的工具方法、旧的流程规章，虽然短期之内并没有大的坏处，但是长久来看，落后是必然的。所以如果有新的想法、新的设计构想、新的技术就要大胆的尝试，虽然不能保证每次尝试都有好的结果，但是如果连努力尝试的想法都没有，一个部门想保持长久的活力也是不可能的。</p>

<p>还是举个例子吧，现在部门内的无线端广告预览只有模拟版本，也就是分辨率可以确定，通过phantomjs来截图。其实都知道如果能实现真机的截图就最好了，考虑很多方面以及testerhome上分享的文章，我们觉得使用stf或许可以完成这样的功能，虽然最后的结果不一定能成，但是尝试又不收费，再说万一要是成了呢。现阶段各种新的技术、新的方法层出不穷，如果能充分利用现有的新技术、新方法，或许可以做到事半功倍。</p>

<h3 id="section-4"><strong>四、论错误排查</strong></h3>

<p>之所以把错误排查单独列出来，是因为我觉得错误排查的能力真的非常非常重要。不管是你自己的程序还是测试工具或者测试环境甚至开发的程序，如果出现了问题，应该知道如何去排查。</p>

<p>现在有些测试同学，都没有自己的测试环境，测试和开发共有一套环境，难道测试的地位真的这么低，都不能有一套独立的测试环境。其实有些时候并非是因为测试地位低，而是测试自己不想去维护这套环境，习惯了只要环境出问题就喊开发来解决，并且认为测试的环境理应当由开发来维护，真不知道为何有这样的想法。如果连维护一套测试环境的能力都没有，还谈什么自动化测试。</p>

<p>我始终相信每个错误的产生必然有其产生的原因。如果一个错误出现了，那么在程序以及资源不发生变化的情况下，其重复出现是必然的。之前出现错误会感到困惑和无奈，而现在则慢慢学会了抽丝剥茧，探索错误产生的根本原因，其实错误排查的过程也充满了乐趣。当然并非每次都是这样，我自己就被一个错误折磨了差不多一个星期，其实差不多都快到崩溃的边缘的，所以耐心也很重要。</p>

<p>举个例子吧，在新的分布式测试系统的实现过程中，就出现了这样一个问题，在docker 节点中通过nosetests来执行case时，有一定的概率server主程序会被杀死，重点就是在这一定概率上，因为对于同一个case有时候server运行是正常的，有些时候则直接被kill掉。我反复将相关的shell以及python脚本通读好多遍，都觉得不应该出现这样的问题。就在我差不多快崩溃的时候，才发现原来node节点中部署了一个case收集程序，这个程序在收集case时会杀掉当前的server程序，由于这是一个crontab任务，所以这才导致了server被杀死的概率性。当时找到这个错误的原因时，真的蓝瘦香菇了。。。</p>

<p>再说一个例子吧，通过docker来部署stf服务的时候，所有都部署完毕，但是stf主程序访问就出现错误，但是stf local程序就可以好好的运行。后来也是经过详细的排查才发现由于stf 容器在vmware虚拟机中运行，而其中的ubuntu虚拟机是采用NAT的方式，这导致了docker0在此网络模式下无法与host进行通信，所以导致无法访问。</p>

<p>举得两个例子是我自己错误排查过程中遇到的两个印象较深的错误，但是好在都找到了原因，其实在错误排查的过程中，你对某程序某方法必要要有很深的了解，要不你怎么排查呢？这样反过来也加深了对某些知识的理解，既解决了问题又涨了知识，这或许是对错误排查过程中所遇到困难的补偿吧。测试同学不要一有问题就找开发了，锻炼一下自己的排错能力吧。。。</p>

<h3 id="section-5"><strong>五、总结</strong></h3>

<p>差不多也就这样了，到今天入职也半年了，点点滴滴都记在心里，整理整理自己的收获、感受、所学也是对过去自己的一个交代。下面是之前发在论坛上的几篇文章，有兴趣的同学可以抽空看看，就到这吧</p>

	  <title>第十章 轻量级日志监控框架AirMonitor</title>
	  <link>//airMonitor</link>
	  <author>Wang Yukun</author>

	  <description><![CDATA[
	     <h4>一、前言</h4>

<p>点睛Front之前的打点验证，是全部靠人工来解决的，测试人员需要查看具体的打点日志，然后找到相关的日志字段，最后来校验此字段值的正确性。如果说偶尔的类似需求，人工来做校验也未尝不可，但是当需求变更非常频繁时，全靠人工来验证所有日志字段就变得极为耗时和低效。</p>

<p>所以处于对此需求的考虑我们开发了AirMonitor日志监控框架，来对日志字段进行监控，对于校验失败的字段发送报警邮件来通知相关的测试与开发。现阶段此日志监控框架已经部署一段时间，
从监控效果来看，达到了初期预设的目标.</p>

<hr />

<h4>二、AirMonitor日志监控框架图</h4>
<p><img src="\images\ads_plantform_monitor.jpg" alt="" title="轻量级日志监控工具" /></p>

<h4>三、AirMonitor日志监控流程简述</h4>
<ul>
  <li>日志收集端从日志源收集数据，现有框架的日志来源分成两种，一种为日志文件，另一种为Redis。</li>
  <li>日志收集后，需要对收集的日志数据进行过滤清洗，这是清洗脏数据的过程，清洗的具体方式是使用正则匹配表达式进行过滤。</li>
  <li>将清洗后的干净的数据通过HTTP报文发送到规则校验服务器，由规则服务器完成整体的校验过程，并将校验的结果返回给监控服务端</li>
  <li>监控服务端根据监控的类型，将接收到的数据分别写入不同的日志结果文件中，例如Redis_pv,Redis_click等</li>
  <li>通过配置Crontab脚本，定时去扫描所生成的日志结果文件，如果有错误发生，则邮件报警通知，并统计每天所有的扫描数量</li>
</ul>

<h4>四、AirMonitor代码结构简述</h4>

<p><strong><em>监控服务端</em></strong>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>ads_check.js 监控服务端主程序,主要用于收集文件文件以及Redis中的日志数据</li>
  <li>redis_node.js  Node版本的redis客户端，调用redis Monitor服务来监控所有写入redis的日志</li>
  <li>error_check.php  Crontab脚本，用来定时扫描日志结果文件，对于出错的日志字段监控报警通知</li>
  <li>tongji.php  Crontab脚本，每天23：00扫描结果文件，统计每天监控的日志数量</li>
</ul>

<p><strong><em>校验服务端</em></strong>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>click_verify.php  redis click打点校验主程序</li>
  <li>combineLog_verify.php  combineLog日志校验主程序</li>
  <li>e_cheatclick_verify.php e_cheatclick日志文件校验主程序</li>
  <li>pv_verify.php  redis pv打点校验主程序</li>
  <li>后缀为xml格式的文件，为打点主程序的规则配置文件如click_rule.xml、combineLog_rule.xml、combineLog_rule.xml等</li>
</ul>

<h4>五、AirMonitor框架设计思想简述</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    <h5>模块化设计</h5>
    <p>模块化的设计有助于降低程序的耦合度，便于程序的调试以及扩展，代码逻辑清楚便于维护。在此框架设计中将日志监控的数据
收集端与数据的校验分成两个独立的模块，使得每个模块代码量较少，维护容易，即便是在日志收集端进行进一步的扩展也变得极为方便。</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h5>数据驱动</h5>
    <p>在日志数据校验模块，采取了校验主程序与规则数据相互独立的策略，使得对某些字段校验规则的扩展以及变更，无须变更主程序，极大方便了后续人员的维护工作。与此同时对于部分功能测试人员，
此框架的上手也极为简单，不需要去理解主程序的设计逻辑，会使用正则匹配表达式即可</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h5>关键词驱动</h5>
    <p>在日志校验模块，除了使用正则匹配表达式完成校验完。还允许测试人员自己定义属于自己的关键词，例如对时间戳字段，我们需要验证其时间必须小于当前时间，则可自定义time关键词来对框架进行扩展，目前只支持php扩展。</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>六、AirMonitor框架的劣势</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>由于规则校验是搭载到nginx服务器上，所以当此框架在高并发大数据量下无法完成实时的规则校验，可采用ELK技术栈来应对大数据量情况</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>规则校验服务端的设计共享性做的不好，从上述代码结构中看到，每一个日志文件的校验都是由独立的文件来完成整体的校验过程。后续可以在此进行优化，采用工厂模式来统一接口，并使用策略模式区分不同的校验类型，做到模块化更加明显，代码结构更加清晰</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>由于现在关键词驱动是直接整合到主校验程序中，当进行自定义关键词时，需要改动相关的校验主程序，且对于某个主程序的改动无法在各主程序之间共享，这都是下次代码重构需要解决的问题。</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="preformattedtext">Preformatted Text</h2>

<p>Typographically, preformatted text is not the same thing as code. Sometimes, a faithful execution of the text requires preformatted text that may not have anything to do with code. Most browsers use Courier and that’s a good default — with one slight adjustment, Courier 10 Pitch over regular Courier for Linux users.</p>

<h3 id="code">Code</h3>

<p>Code can be presented inline, like <code>&lt;?php bloginfo('stylesheet_url'); ?&gt;</code>, or within a <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code> block. Because we have more specific typographic needs for code, we’ll specify Consolas and Monaco ahead of the browser-defined monospace font.</p>

<p>Code blocks can also be inserted with the highlight tag as below:</p>
<pre>
    
    {% highlight language-x %}
    # some code
    {% endhighlight %}
    
</pre>

<p>More information about code highlighting in jekyll can be found  <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/templates/#code-snippet-highlighting">in Jekyll documentation</a>.</p>

<p>These area a couple of examples showing the resulting highlighted code:</p>

	  <description><![CDATA[
	     <p>An American businessman took a vacation to a small coastal Mexican village on doctor’s orders. Unable to sleep after an urgent phone call from the office the first morning, he walked out to the pier to clear his head. A small boat with just one fisherman had docked, and inside the boat were several large yellowfin tuna. The American complimented the Mexican on the quality of his fish.</p>

<p>“How long did it take you to catch them?” the American asked.</p>

<p>“Only a little while,” the Mexican replied in surprisingly good English.</p>

<p>“Why don’t you stay out longer and catch more fish?” the American then asked.</p>

<p>“I have enough to support my family and give a few to friends,” the Mexican said as he unloaded them into a basket.</p>

<p>“But… What do you do with the rest of your time?”</p>

<p>The Mexican looked up and smiled. “I sleep late, fish a little, play with my children, take a siesta with my wife, Julia, and stroll into the village each evening, where I sip wine and play guitar with my amigos. I have a full and busy life, señor.”</p>

<p>The American laughed and stood tall. “Sir, I’m a Harvard M.B.A. and can help you. You should spend more time fishing, and with the proceeds, buy a bigger boat. In no time, you could buy several boats with the increased haul. Eventually, you would have a fleet of fishing boats.”</p>

<p>He continued, “Instead of selling your catch to a middleman, you would sell directly to the consumers, eventually opening your own cannery. You would control the product, processing, and distribution. You would need to leave this small coastal fishing village, of course, and move to Mexico City, then to Los Angeles, and eventually to New York City, where you could run your expanded enterprise with proper management.</p>

<p>The Mexican fisherman asked, “But, señor, how long will all this take?”</p>

<p>To which the American replied, “15-20 years, 25 tops.”</p>

<p>“But what then, señor?”</p>

<p>The American laughed and said, “That’s the best part. When the time is right, you would announce an IPO and sell your company stock to the public and become very rich. You would make millions.”</p>

<p>“Millions señor? Then what?”</p>

<p>“Then you would retire and move to a small coastal fishing village, where you would sleep late, fish a little, play with your kids, take a siesta with your wife, and stroll in to the village in the evenings where you could sip wine and play your guitar with your amigos.”</p>

	  <description><![CDATA[
	     <p>I am happy to join with you today in what will go down in history as the greatest demonstration for freedom in the history of our nation.</p>

<p>Five score years ago, a great American, in whose symbolic shadow we stand today, signed the Emancipation Proclamation. This momentous decree came as a great beacon light of hope to millions of Negro slaves who had been seared in the flames of withering injustice. It came as a joyous daybreak to end the long night of their captivity.</p>

<p>But one hundred years later, the Negro still is not free. One hundred years later, the life of the Negro is still sadly crippled by the manacles of segregation and the chains of discrimination. One hundred years later, the Negro lives on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity. One hundred years later, the Negro is still languished in the corners of American society and finds himself an exile in his own land. And so we’ve come here today to dramatize a shameful condition.</p>

<p>In a sense we’ve come to our nation’s capital to cash a check. When the architects of our republic wrote the magnificent words of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence, they were signing a promissory note to which every American was to fall heir. This note was a promise that all men, yes, black men as well as white men, would be guaranteed the “unalienable Rights” of “Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.” It is obvious today that America has defaulted on this promissory note, insofar as her citizens of color are concerned. Instead of honoring this sacred obligation, America has given the Negro people a bad check, a check which has come back marked “insufficient funds.”</p>

<p>But we refuse to believe that the bank of justice is bankrupt. We refuse to believe that there are insufficient funds in the great vaults of opportunity of this nation. And so, we’ve come to cash this check, a check that will give us upon demand the riches of freedom and the security of justice.</p>

<p>We have also come to this hallowed spot to remind America of the fierce urgency of Now. This is no time to engage in the luxury of cooling off or to take the tranquilizing drug of gradualism. Now is the time to make real the promises of democracy. Now is the time to rise from the dark and desolate valley of segregation to the sunlit path of racial justice. Now is the time to lift our nation from the quicksands of racial injustice to the solid rock of brotherhood. Now is the time to make justice a reality for all of God’s children.</p>

<p>It would be fatal for the nation to overlook the urgency of the moment. This sweltering summer of the Negro’s legitimate discontent will not pass until there is an invigorating autumn of freedom and equality. Nineteen sixty-three is not an end, but a beginning. And those who hope that the Negro needed to blow off steam and will now be content will have a rude awakening if the nation returns to business as usual. And there will be neither rest nor tranquility in America until the Negro is granted his citizenship rights. The whirlwinds of revolt will continue to shake the foundations of our nation until the bright day of justice emerges.</p>

<p>But there is something that I must say to my people, who stand on the warm threshold which leads into the palace of justice: In the process of gaining our rightful place, we must not be guilty of wrongful deeds. Let us not seek to satisfy our thirst for freedom by drinking from the cup of bitterness and hatred. We must forever conduct our struggle on the high plane of dignity and discipline. We must not allow our creative protest to degenerate into physical violence. Again and again, we must rise to the majestic heights of meeting physical force with soul force.</p>

<p>The marvelous new militancy which has engulfed the Negro community must not lead us to a distrust of all white people, for many of our white brothers, as evidenced by their presence here today, have come to realize that their destiny is tied up with our destiny. And they have come to realize that their freedom is inextricably bound to our freedom.</p>

<p>We cannot walk alone.</p>

<p>And as we walk, we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead.</p>

<p>We cannot turn back.</p>

<p>There are those who are asking the devotees of civil rights, “When will you be satisfied?” We can never be satisfied as long as the Negro is the victim of the unspeakable horrors of police brutality. We can never be satisfied as long as our bodies, heavy with the fatigue of travel, cannot gain lodging in the motels of the highways and the hotels of the cities. We cannot be satisfied as long as the negro’s basic mobility is from a smaller ghetto to a larger one. We can never be satisfied as long as our children are stripped of their self-hood and robbed of their dignity by signs stating: “For Whites Only.” We cannot be satisfied as long as a Negro in Mississippi cannot vote and a Negro in New York believes he has nothing for which to vote. No, no, we are not satisfied, and we will not be satisfied until “justice rolls down like waters, and righteousness like a mighty stream.”</p>

<p>I am not unmindful that some of you have come here out of great trials and tribulations. Some of you have come fresh from narrow jail cells. And some of you have come from areas where your quest – quest for freedom left you battered by the storms of persecution and staggered by the winds of police brutality. You have been the veterans of creative suffering. Continue to work with the faith that unearned suffering is redemptive. Go back to Mississippi, go back to Alabama, go back to South Carolina, go back to Georgia, go back to Louisiana, go back to the slums and ghettos of our northern cities, knowing that somehow this situation can and will be changed.</p>

<p>Let us not wallow in the valley of despair, I say to you today, my friends.</p>

<p>And so even though we face the difficulties of today and tomorrow, I still have a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted in the American dream.</p>

<p>I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: “We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal.”</p>

<p>I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia, the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood.</p>

<p>I have a dream that one day even the state of Mississippi, a state sweltering with the heat of injustice, sweltering with the heat of oppression, will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice.</p>

<p>I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.</p>

<p>I have a <strong>dream</strong> today!</p>

<p>I have a dream that one day, down in Alabama, with its vicious racists, with its governor having his lips dripping with the words of “interposition” and “nullification” – one day right there in Alabama little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers.</p>

<p>I have a <strong>dream</strong> today!</p>

<p>I have a dream that one day every valley shall be exalted, and every hill and mountain shall be made low, the rough places will be made plain, and the crooked places will be made straight; “and the glory of the Lord shall be revealed and all flesh shall see it together.”</p>

<p>This is our hope, and this is the faith that I go back to the South with.</p>

<p>With this faith, we will be able to hew out of the mountain of despair a stone of hope. With this faith, we will be able to transform the jangling discords of our nation into a beautiful symphony of brotherhood. With this faith, we will be able to work together, to pray together, to struggle together, to go to jail together, to stand up for freedom together, knowing that we will be free one day.</p>

<p>And this will be the day – this will be the day when all of God’s children will be able to sing with new meaning:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>My country ‘tis of thee, sweet land of liberty, of thee I sing.</p>

  <p>Land where my fathers died, land of the Pilgrim’s pride,</p>

  <p>From every mountainside, let freedom ring!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And if America is to be a great nation, this must become true.</p>

<p>And so let freedom ring from the prodigious hilltops of New Hampshire.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Let freedom ring from the mighty mountains of New York.</p>

  <p>Let freedom ring from the heightening Alleghenies of Pennsylvania.</p>

  <p>Let freedom ring from the snow-capped Rockies of Colorado.</p>

  <p>Let freedom ring from the curvaceous slopes of California.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But not only that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Let freedom ring from Stone Mountain of Georgia.</p>

  <p>Let freedom ring from Lookout Mountain of Tennessee.</p>

  <p>Let freedom ring from every hill and molehill of Mississippi.</p>

  <p>From every mountainside, let freedom ring.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And when this happens, and when we allow freedom ring, when we let it ring from every village and every hamlet, from every state and every city, we will be able to speed up that day when all of God’s children, black men and white men, Jews and Gentiles, Protestants and Catholics, will be able to join hands and sing in the words of the old Negro spiritual:</p>

<p><em>Free at last! Free at last!</em></p>

<p><em>Thank God Almighty, we are free at last!</em></p>

	  <title>The Purpose of Education</title>

	  <description><![CDATA[
	     <p>As I engage in the so-called “bull sessions” around and about the school, I too often find that most college men have a misconception of the purpose of education. Most of the “brethren” think that education should equip them with the proper instruments of exploitation so that they can forever trample over the masses. Still others think that education should furnish them with noble ends rather than means to an end.</p>

<p>It seems to me that education has a two-fold function to perform in the life of man and in society: the one is utility and the other is culture. Education must enable a man to become more efficient, to achieve with increasing facility the ligitimate goals of his life.</p>

<p>Education must also train one for quick, resolute and effective thinking. To think incisively and to think for one’s self is very difficult. We are prone to let our mental life become invaded by legions of half truths, prejudices, and propaganda. At this point, I often wonder whether or not education is fulfilling its purpose. A great majority of the so-called educated people do not think logically and scientifically. Even the press, the classroom, the platform, and the pulpit in many instances do not give us objective and unbiased truths. To save man from the morass of propaganda, in my opinion, is one of the chief aims of education. Education must enable one to sift and weigh evidence, to discern the true from the false, the real from the unreal, and the facts from the fiction.</p>

<p>The function of education, therefore, is to teach one to think intensively and to think critically. But education which stops with efficiency may prove the greatest menace to society. The most dangerous criminal may be the man gifted with reason, but with no morals.</p>

<p>The late Eugene Talmadge, in my opinion, possessed one of the better minds of Georgia, or even America. Moreover, he wore the Phi Beta Kappa key. By all measuring rods, Mr. Talmadge could think critically and intensively; yet he contends that I am an inferior being. Are those the types of men we call educated?</p>

<p>We must remember that intelligence is not enough. Intelligence plus character–that is the goal of true education. The complete education gives one not only power of concentration, but worthy objectives upon which to concentrate. The broad education will, therefore, transmit to one not only the accumulated knowledge of the race but also the accumulated experience of social living.</p>

<p>If we are not careful, our colleges will produce a group of close-minded, unscientific, illogical propagandists, consumed with immoral acts. Be careful, “brethren!” Be careful, teachers!</p>

	  <description><![CDATA[
	     <p>I had this story from one who had no business to tell it to me, or to any other. I may credit the seductive influence of an old vintage upon the narrator for the beginning of it, and my own skeptical incredulity during the days that followed for the balance of the strange tale.</p>

<p>When my convivial host discovered that he had told me so much, and that I was prone to doubtfulness, his foolish pride assumed the task the old vintage had commenced, and so he unearthed written evidence in the form of musty manuscript, and dry official records of the British Colonial Office to support many of the salient features of his remarkable narrative.</p>

<p>I do not say the story is true, for I did not witness the happenings which it portrays, but the fact that in the telling of it to you I have taken fictitious names for the principal characters quite sufficiently evidences the sincerity of my own belief that it MAY be true.</p>

<p>The yellow, mildewed pages of the diary of a man long dead, and the records of the Colonial Office dovetail perfectly with the narrative of my convivial host, and so I give you the story as I painstakingly pieced it out from these several various agencies.</p>

<p>If you do not find it credible you will at least be as one with me in acknowledging that it is unique, remarkable, and interesting.</p>

<p>From the records of the Colonial Office and from the dead man’s diary we learn that a certain young English nobleman, whom we shall call John Clayton, Lord Greystoke, was commissioned to make a peculiarly delicate investigation of conditions in a British West Coast African Colony from whose simple native inhabitants another European power was known to be recruiting soldiers for its native army, which it used solely for the forcible collection of rubber and ivory from the savage tribes along the Congo and the Aruwimi. The natives of the British Colony complained that many of their young men were enticed away through the medium of fair and glowing promises, but that few if any ever returned to their families.</p>

<p>The Englishmen in Africa went even further, saying that these poor blacks were held in virtual slavery, since after their terms of enlistment expired their ignorance was imposed upon by their white officers, and they were told that they had yet several years to serve.</p>

<p>And so the Colonial Office appointed John Clayton to a new post in British West Africa, but his confidential instructions centered on a thorough investigation of the unfair treatment of black British subjects by the officers of a friendly European power. Why he was sent, is, however, of little moment to this story, for he never made an investigation, nor, in fact, did he ever reach his destination.</p>

<p>Clayton was the type of Englishman that one likes best to associate with the noblest monuments of historic achievement upon a thousand victorious battlefields–a strong, virile man –mentally, morally, and physically.</p>

<p>In stature he was above the average height; his eyes were gray, his features regular and strong; his carriage that of perfect, robust health influenced by his years of army training.</p>

<p>Political ambition had caused him to seek transference from the army to the Colonial Office and so we find him, still young, entrusted with a delicate and important commission in the service of the Queen.</p>

<p>When he received this appointment he was both elated and appalled. The preferment seemed to him in the nature of a well-merited reward for painstaking and intelligent service, and as a stepping stone to posts of greater importance and responsibility; but, on the other hand, he had been married to the Hon. Alice Rutherford for scarce a three months, and it was the thought of taking this fair young girl into the dangers and isolation of tropical Africa that appalled him.</p>

<p>For her sake he would have refused the appointment, but she would not have it so. Instead she insisted that he accept, and, indeed, take her with him.</p>

<p>There were mothers and brothers and sisters, and aunts and cousins to express various opinions on the subject, but as to what they severally advised history is silent.</p>

<p>We know only that on a bright May morning in 1888, John, Lord Greystoke, and Lady Alice sailed from Dover on their way to Africa.</p>

<p>A month later they arrived at Freetown where they chartered a small sailing vessel, the Fuwalda, which was to bear them to their final destination.</p>

<p>And here John, Lord Greystoke, and Lady Alice, his wife, vanished from the eyes and from the knowledge of men.</p>

<p>Two months after they weighed anchor and cleared from the port of Freetown a half dozen British war vessels were scouring the south Atlantic for trace of them or their little vessel, and it was almost immediately that the wreckage was found upon the shores of St. Helena which convinced the world that the Fuwalda had gone down with all on board, and hence the search was stopped ere it had scarce begun; though hope lingered in longing hearts for many years.</p>

<p>The Fuwalda, a barkentine of about one hundred tons, was a vessel of the type often seen in coastwise trade in the far southern Atlantic, their crews composed of the offscourings of the sea–unhanged murderers and cutthroats of every race and every nation.</p>

<p>The Fuwalda was no exception to the rule. Her officers were swarthy bullies, hating and hated by their crew. The captain, while a competent seaman, was a brute in his treatment of his men. He knew, or at least he used, but two arguments in his dealings with them–a belaying pin and a revolver–nor is it likely that the motley aggregation he signed would have understood aught else.</p>

<p>So it was that from the second day out from Freetown John Clayton and his young wife witnessed scenes upon the deck of the Fuwalda such as they had believed were never enacted outside the covers of printed stories of the sea.</p>

<p>It was on the morning of the second day that the first link was forged in what was destined to form a chain of circumstances ending in a life for one then unborn such as has never been paralleled in the history of man.</p>

<p>Two sailors were washing down the decks of the Fuwalda, the first mate was on duty, and the captain had stopped to speak with John Clayton and Lady Alice.</p>

<p>The men were working backwards toward the little party who were facing away from the sailors. Closer and closer they came, until one of them was directly behind the captain. In another moment he would have passed by and this strange narrative would never have been recorded.</p>

<p>But just that instant the officer turned to leave Lord and Lady Greystoke, and, as he did so, tripped against the sailor and sprawled headlong upon the deck, overturning the water- pail so that he was drenched in its dirty contents.</p>

<p>For an instant the scene was ludicrous; but only for an instant. With a volley of awful oaths, his face suffused with the scarlet of mortification and rage, the captain regained his feet, and with a terrific blow felled the sailor to the deck.</p>

<p>The man was small and rather old, so that the brutality of the act was thus accentuated. The other seaman, however, was neither old nor small–a huge bear of a man, with fierce black mustachios, and a great bull neck set between massive shoulders.</p>

<p>As he saw his mate go down he crouched, and, with a low snarl, sprang upon the captain crushing him to his knees with a single mighty blow.</p>

<p>From scarlet the officer’s face went white, for this was mutiny; and mutiny he had met and subdued before in his brutal career. Without waiting to rise he whipped a revolver from his pocket, firing point blank at the great mountain of muscle towering before him; but, quick as he was, John Clayton was almost as quick, so that the bullet which was intended for the sailor’s heart lodged in the sailor’s leg instead, for Lord Greystoke had struck down the captain’s arm as he had seen the weapon flash in the sun.</p>

<p>Words passed between Clayton and the captain, the former making it plain that he was disgusted with the brutality displayed toward the crew, nor would he countenance anything further of the kind while he and Lady Greystoke remained passengers.</p>

<p>The captain was on the point of making an angry reply, but, thinking better of it, turned on his heel and black and scowling, strode aft.</p>

<p>He did not care to antagonize an English official, for the Queen’s mighty arm wielded a punitive instrument which he could appreciate, and which he feared–England’s far-reaching navy.</p>

<p>The two sailors picked themselves up, the older man assisting his wounded comrade to rise. The big fellow, who was known among his mates as Black Michael, tried his leg gingerly, and, finding that it bore his weight, turned to Clayton with a word of gruff thanks.</p>

<p>Though the fellow’s tone was surly, his words were evidently well meant. Ere he had scarce finished his little speech he had turned and was limping off toward the forecastle with the very apparent intention of forestalling any further conversation.</p>

<p>They did not see him again for several days, nor did the captain accord them more than the surliest of grunts when he was forced to speak to them.</p>

<p>They took their meals in his cabin, as they had before the unfortunate occurrence; but the captain was careful to see that his duties never permitted him to eat at the same time.</p>

<p>The other officers were coarse, illiterate fellows, but little above the villainous crew they bullied, and were only too glad to avoid social intercourse with the polished English noble and his lady, so that the Claytons were left very much to themselves.</p>

<p>This in itself accorded perfectly with their desires, but it also rather isolated them from the life of the little ship so that they were unable to keep in touch with the daily happenings which were to culminate so soon in bloody tragedy.</p>

	  <description><![CDATA[
	     <p>One thing was certain, that the white kitten had had nothing to do with it:— it was the black kitten’s fault entirely. For the white kitten had been having its face washed by the old cat for the last quarter of an hour (and bearing it pretty well, considering); so you see that it couldn’t have had any hand in the mischief. 
The way Dinah washed her children’s faces was this: first she held the poor thing down by its ear with one paw, and then with the other paw she rubbed its face all over, the wrong way, beginning at the nose: and just now, as I said, she was hard at work on the white kitten, which was lying quite still and trying to purr — no doubt feeling that it was all meant for its good. 
But the black kitten had been finished with earlier in the afternoon, and so, while Alice was sitting curled up in a corner of the great arm-chair, half talking to herself and half asleep, the kitten had been having a grand game of romps with the ball of worsted Alice had been trying to wind up, and had been rolling it up and down till it had all come undone again; and there it was, spread over the hearth-rug, all knots and tangles, with the kitten running after its own tail in the middle.</p>

<p>‘Oh, you wicked little thing!’ cried Alice, catching up the kitten, and giving it a little kiss to make it understand that it was in disgrace. ‘Really, Dinah ought to have taught you better manners! You ought, Dinah, you know you ought!’ she added, looking reproachfully at the old cat, and speaking in as cross a voice as she could manage — and then she scrambled back into the arm-chair, taking the kitten and the worsted with her, and began winding up the ball again. But she didn’t get on very fast, as she was talking all the time, sometimes to the kitten, and sometimes to herself. Kitty sat very demurely on her knee, pretending to watch the progress of the winding, and now and then putting out one paw and gently touching the ball, as if it would be glad to help, if it might. ‘Do you know what to-morrow is, Kitty?’ Alice began. ‘You’d have guessed if you’d been up in the window with me — only Dinah was making you tidy, so you couldn’t. I was watching the boys getting in sticks for the bonfire — and it wants plenty of sticks, Kitty! Only it got so cold, and it snowed so, they had to leave off. Never mind, Kitty, we’ll go and see the bonfire to-morrow.’ Here Alice wound two or three turns of the worsted round the kitten’s neck, just to see how it would look: this led to a scramble, in which the ball rolled down upon the floor, and yards and yards of it got unwound again.</p>

<p>‘Do you know, I was so angry, Kitty,’ Alice went on as soon as they were comfortably settled again, ‘when I saw all the mischief you had been doing, I was very nearly opening the window, and putting you out into the snow! And you’d have deserved it, you little mischievous darling! What have you got to say for yourself? Now don’t interrupt me!’ she went on, holding up one finger. ‘I’m going to tell you all your faults. Number one: you squeaked twice while Dinah was washing your face this morning. Now you can’t deny it, Kitty: I heard you! What’s that you say?’ (pretending that the kitten was speaking.) ‘Her paw went into your eye? Well, that’s your fault, for keeping your eyes open — if you’d shut them tight up, it wouldn’t have happened. Now don’t make any more excuses, but listen! Number two: you pulled Snowdrop away by the tail just as I had put down the saucer of milk before her! What, you were thirsty, were you? How do you know she wasn’t thirsty too? Now for number three: you unwound every bit of the worsted while I wasn’t looking! 
‘That’s three faults, Kitty, and you’ve not been punished for any of them yet. You know I’m saving up all your punishments for Wednesday week — Suppose they had saved up all my punishments!’ she went on, talking more to herself than the kitten. ‘What would they do at the end of a year? I should be sent to prison, I suppose, when the day came. Or — let me see — suppose each punishment was to be going without a dinner: then, when the miserable day came, I should have to go without fifty dinners at once! Well, I shouldn’t mind that much! I’d far rather go without them than eat them! ‘Do you hear the snow against the window-panes, Kitty? How nice and soft it sounds! Just as if some one was kissing the window all over outside. I wonder if the snow loves the trees and fields, that it kisses them so gently? And then it covers them up snug, you know, with a white quilt; and perhaps it says, “Go to sleep, darlings, till the summer comes again.” And when they wake up in the summer, Kitty, they dress themselves all in green, and dance about — whenever the wind blows — oh, that’s very pretty!’ cried Alice, dropping the ball of worsted to clap her hands. ‘And I do so wish it was true! I’m sure the woods look sleepy in the autumn, when the leaves are getting brown. ‘Kitty, can you play chess? Now, don’t smile, my dear, I’m asking it seriously. Because, when we were playing just now, you watched just as if you understood it: and when I said “Check!” you purred! Well, it was a nice check, Kitty, and really I might have won, if it hadn’t been for that nasty Knight, that came wiggling down among my pieces. Kitty, dear, let’s pretend —’ And here I wish I could tell you half the things Alice used to say, beginning with her favourite phrase ‘Let’s pretend.’ She had had quite a long argument with her sister only the day before — all because Alice had begun with ‘Let’s pretend we’re kings and queens;’ and her sister, who liked being very exact, had argued that they couldn’t, because there were only two of them, and Alice had been reduced at last to say, ‘Well, you can be one of them then, and I’ll be all the rest.’ And once she had really frightened her old nurse by shouting suddenly in her ear, ‘Nurse! Do let’s pretend that I’m a hungry hyaena, and you’re a bone.’ But this is taking us away from Alice’s speech to the kitten. ‘Let’s pretend that you’re the Red Queen, Kitty! Do you know, I think if you sat up and folded your arms, you’d look exactly like her. Now do try, there’s a dear!’ And Alice got the Red Queen off the table, and set it up before the kitten as a model for it to imitate: however, the thing didn’t succeed, principally, Alice said, because the kitten wouldn’t fold its arms properly. So, to punish it, she held it up to the Looking-glass, that it might see how sulky it was —‘and if you’re not good directly,’ she added, ‘I’ll put you through into Looking-glass House. How would you like that?’ 
‘Now, if you’ll only attend, Kitty, and not talk so much, I’ll tell you all my ideas about Looking-glass House. First, there’s the room you can see through the glass — that’s just the same as our drawing room, only the things go the other way. I can see all of it when I get upon a chair — all but the bit behind the fireplace. Oh! I do so wish I could see that bit! I want so much to know whether they’ve a fire in the winter: you never can tell, you know, unless our fire smokes, and then smoke comes up in that room too — but that may be only pretence, just to make it look as if they had a fire. Well then, the books are something like our books, only the words go the wrong way; I know that, because I’ve held up one of our books to the glass, and then they hold up one in the other room. ‘How would you like to live in Looking-glass House, Kitty? I wonder if they’d give you milk in there? Perhaps Looking-glass milk isn’t good to drink — But oh, Kitty! now we come to the passage. You can just see a little peep of the passage in Looking-glass House, if you leave the door of our drawing-room wide open: and it’s very like our passage as far as you can see, only you know it may be quite different on beyond. Oh, Kitty! how nice it would be if we could only get through into Looking-glass House! I’m sure it’s got, oh! such beautiful things in it! Let’s pretend there’s a way of getting through into it, somehow, Kitty. Let’s pretend the glass has got all soft like gauze, so that we can get through. Why, it’s turning into a sort of mist now, I declare! It’ll be easy enough to get through —’ She was up on the chimney-piece while she said this, though she hardly knew how she had got there. And certainly the glass was beginning to melt away, just like a bright silvery mist.</p>

<p>In another moment Alice was through the glass, and had jumped lightly down into the Looking-glass room. The very first thing she did was to look whether there was a fire in the fireplace, and she was quite pleased to find that there was a real one, blazing away as brightly as the one she had left behind. ‘So I shall be as warm here as I was in the old room,’ thought Alice: ‘warmer, in fact, because there’ll be no one here to scold me away from the fire. Oh, what fun it’ll be, when they see me through the glass in here, and can’t get at me!’</p>

<p>Then she began looking about, and noticed that what could be seen from the old room was quite common and uninteresting, but that all the rest was as different as possible. For instance, the pictures on the wall next the fire seemed to be all alive, and the very clock on the chimney-piece (you know you can only see the back of it in the Looking-glass) had got the face of a little old man, and grinned at her. 
‘They don’t keep this room so tidy as the other,’ Alice thought to herself, as she noticed several of the chessmen down in the hearth among the cinders: but in another moment, with a little ‘Oh!’ of surprise, she was down on her hands and knees watching them. The chessmen were walking about, two and two!</p>

<p>‘Here are the Red King and the Red Queen,’ Alice said (in a whisper, for fear of frightening them), ‘and there are the White King and the White Queen sitting on the edge of the shovel — and here are two castles walking arm in arm — I don’t think they can hear me,’ she went on, as she put her head closer down, ‘and I’m nearly sure they can’t see me. I feel somehow as if I were invisible —’ Here something began squeaking on the table behind Alice, and made her turn her head just in time to see one of the White Pawns roll over and begin kicking: she watched it with great curiosity to see what would happen next. 
‘It is the voice of my child!’ the White Queen cried out as she rushed past the King, so violently that she knocked him over among the cinders. ‘My precious Lily! My imperial kitten!’ and she began scrambling wildly up the side of the fender. ‘Imperial fiddlestick!’ said the King, rubbing his nose, which had been hurt by the fall. He had a right to be a little annoyed with the Queen, for he was covered with ashes from head to foot. Alice was very anxious to be of use, and, as the poor little Lily was nearly screaming herself into a fit, she hastily picked up the Queen and set her on the table by the side of her noisy little daughter. 
The Queen gasped, and sat down: the rapid journey through the air had quite taken away her breath and for a minute or two she could do nothing but hug the little Lily in silence. As soon as she had recovered her breath a little, she called out to the White King, who was sitting sulkily among the ashes, ‘Mind the volcano!’ 
‘What volcano?’ said the King, looking up anxiously into the fire, as if he thought that was the most likely place to find one. ‘Blew — me — up,’ panted the Queen, who was still a little out of breath. ‘Mind you come up — the regular way — don’t get blown up!’ Alice watched the White King as he slowly struggled up from bar to bar, till at last she said, ‘Why, you’ll be hours and hours getting to the table, at that rate. I’d far better help you, hadn’t I?’ But the King took no notice of the question: it was quite clear that he could neither hear her nor see her. 
So Alice picked him up very gently, and lifted him across more slowly than she had lifted the Queen, that she mightn’t take his breath away: but, before she put him on the table, she thought she might as well dust him a little, he was so covered with ashes.</p>

<p>She said afterwards that she had never seen in all her life such a face as the King made, when he found himself held in the air by an invisible hand, and being dusted: he was far too much astonished to cry out, but his eyes and his mouth went on getting larger and larger, and rounder and rounder, till her hand shook so with laughing that she nearly let him drop upon the floor. 
‘Oh! please don’t make such faces, my dear!’ she cried out, quite forgetting that the King couldn’t hear her. ‘You make me laugh so that I can hardly hold you! And don’t keep your mouth so wide open! All the ashes will get into it — there, now I think you’re tidy enough!’ she added, as she smoothed his hair, and set him upon the table near the Queen. The King immediately fell flat on his back, and lay perfectly still: and Alice was a little alarmed at what she had done, and went round the room to see if she could find any water to throw over him. However, she could find nothing but a bottle of ink, and when she got back with it she found he had recovered, and he and the Queen were talking together in a frightened whisper — so low, that Alice could hardly hear what they said. 
The King was saying, ‘I assure, you my dear, I turned cold to the very ends of my whiskers!’ 
To which the Queen replied, ‘You haven’t got any whiskers.’ 
‘The horror of that moment,’ the King went on, ‘I shall never, never forget!’ ‘You will, though,’ the Queen said, ‘if you don’t make a memorandum of it.’ Alice looked on with great interest as the King took an enormous memorandum-book out of his pocket, and began writing. A sudden thought struck her, and she took hold of the end of the pencil, which came some way over his shoulder, and began writing for him. 
The poor King looked puzzled and unhappy, and struggled with the pencil for some time without saying anything; but Alice was too strong for him, and at last he panted out, ‘My dear! I really must get a thinner pencil. I can’t manage this one a bit; it writes all manner of things that I don’t intend —’ 
‘What manner of things?’ said the Queen, looking over the book (in which Alice had put ‘the White Knight is sliding down the poker. He balances very badly’) ‘That’s not a memorandum of your feelings!’</p>

	     <p>Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, ‘and what is the use of a book,’ thought Alice ‘without pictures or conversation?’</p>

<p>So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.</p>

<p>There was nothing so very remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so very much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, ‘Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!’ (when she thought it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually took a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.</p>

<p>In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how in the world she was to get out again.</p>

<p>The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep well.</p>

<p>Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was going to happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out what she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed; it was labelled ‘ORANGE MARMALADE’, but to her great disappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing somebody, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past it.</p>

<p>‘Well!’ thought Alice to herself, ‘after such a fall as this, I shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave they’ll all think me at home! Why, I wouldn’t say anything about it, even if I fell off the top of the house!’ (Which was very likely true.)</p>

<p>Down, down, down. Would the fall never come to an end! ‘I wonder how many miles I’ve fallen by this time?’ she said aloud. ‘I must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would be four thousand miles down, I think—’ (for, you see, Alice had learnt several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and though this was not a very good opportunity for showing off her knowledge, as there was no one to listen to her, still it was good practice to say it over) ‘—yes, that’s about the right distance—but then I wonder what Latitude or Longitude I’ve got to?’ (Alice had no idea what Latitude was, or Longitude either, but thought they were nice grand words to say.)</p>

<p>Presently she began again. ‘I wonder if I shall fall right through the earth! How funny it’ll seem to come out among the people that walk with their heads downward! The Antipathies, I think—’ (she was rather glad there was no one listening, this time, as it didn’t sound at all the right word) ‘—but I shall have to ask them what the name of the country is, you know. Please, Ma’am, is this New Zealand or Australia?’ (and she tried to curtsey as she spoke—fancy curtseying as you’re falling through the air! Do you think you could manage it?) ‘And what an ignorant little girl she’ll think me for asking! No, it’ll never do to ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.’</p>

<p>Down, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began talking again. ‘Dinah’ll miss me very much to-night, I should think!’ (Dinah was the cat.) ‘I hope they’ll remember her saucer of milk at tea-time. Dinah my dear! I wish you were down here with me! There are no mice in the air, I’m afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that’s very like a mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?’ And here Alice began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy sort of way, ‘Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?’ and sometimes, ‘Do bats eat cats?’ for, you see, as she couldn’t answer either question, it didn’t much matter which way she put it. She felt that she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand with Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly, ‘Now, Dinah, tell me the truth: did you ever eat a bat?’ when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over.</p>

<p>Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment: she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was another long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down it. There was not a moment to be lost: away went Alice like the wind, and was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, ‘Oh my ears and whiskers, how late it’s getting!’ She was close behind it when she turned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging from the roof.</p>

<p>There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when Alice had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to get out again.</p>

<p>Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and Alice’s first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall; but, alas! either the locks were too large, or the key was too small, but at any rate it would not open any of them.</p>

<p>However, on the second time round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high: she tried the little golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!</p>

<p>Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not much larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to get out of that dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head though the doorway; ‘and even if my head would go through,’ thought poor Alice, ‘it would be of very little use without my shoulders. Oh, how I wish I could shut up like a telescope! I think I could, if I only know how to begin.’ For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few things indeed were really impossible.</p>

<p>There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this time she found a little bottle on it, (‘which certainly was not here before,’ said Alice,) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper label, with the words ‘DRINK ME’ beautifully printed on it in large letters.</p>

<p>It was all very well to say ‘Drink me,’ but the wise little Alice was not going to do that in a hurry. ‘No, I’ll look first,’ she said, ‘and see whether it’s marked “poison” or not’; for she had read several nice little histories about children who had got burnt, and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things, all because they would not remember the simple rules their friends had taught them: such as, that a red-hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long; and that if you cut your finger very deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds; and she had never forgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked ‘poison,’ it is almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or later.</p>

<p>However, this bottle was not marked ‘poison,’ so Alice ventured to taste it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort of mixed flavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast turkey, toffee, and hot buttered toast,) she very soon finished it off.</p>

<p>‘What a curious feeling!’ said Alice; ‘I must be shutting up like a telescope.’</p>

<p>And so it was indeed: she was now only ten inches high, and her face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going through the little door into that lovely garden. First, however, she waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further: she felt a little nervous about this; ‘for it might end, you know,’ said Alice to herself, ‘in my going out altogether, like a candle. I wonder what I should be like then?’ And she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle is like after the candle is blown out, for she could not remember ever having seen such a thing.</p>

<p>After a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going into the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice! when she got to the door, she found she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she went back to the table for it, she found she could not possibly reach it: she could see it quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her best to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery; and when she had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing sat down and cried.</p>

<p>‘Come, there’s no use in crying like that!’ said Alice to herself, rather sharply; ‘I advise you to leave off this minute!’ She generally gave herself very good advice, (though she very seldom followed it), and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into her eyes; and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having cheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself, for this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people. ‘But it’s no use now,’ thought poor Alice, ‘to pretend to be two people! Why, there’s hardly enough of me left to make one respectable person!’</p>

<p>Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table: she opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on which the words ‘EAT ME’ were beautifully marked in currants. ‘Well, I’ll eat it,’ said Alice, ‘and if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the key; and if it makes me grow smaller, I can creep under the door; so either way I’ll get into the garden, and I don’t care which happens!’</p>

<p>She ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, ‘Which way? Which way?’, holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was growing, and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same size: to be sure, this generally happens when one eats cake, but Alice had got so much into the way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way things to happen, that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the common way.</p>

<p>So she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake.</p>
